"Is a common bacterium, genre Enterobacteria, Gram-negative. We can distinguish about 171 serotype. It is normally present in the intestine of all humans and mammals and are necessary for the correct digestion of the food. There can be situation in which E. coli can provoke sickness and other disturbance on the man, like intestinal and urinary infections, meningitis, peritonitis,  septicemy and pneumonia. This mostly happens through alimentar infection, but polluted water is also very risky. This kind of pollution is entirely caused by human activities. The limit value for italian coast-water was established at 500 millions of Unities forming a colony (UFC), for 100 ml of water" = "Is a common bacterium, genre Enterobacteria, Gram-negative.

"Enterococci are facultative anaerobic organisms, i.e., they are capable of cellular respiration in both oxygen-rich and oxygen-poor environments. Enterococci often occur in pairs (diplococci) or short chains. Important clinical infections caused by Enterococcus include urinary tract infections, bacteremia, bacterial endocarditis, diverticulitis, and meningitis. In bodies of water, the acceptable level of contamination is very low. The treshold limit is however established at 200 millions of Unities forming a colony (UFC), for 100 ml of water." = "Enterococci are facultative anaerobic organisms, i.e., they are capable of cellular respiration in both oxygen-rich and oxygen-poor environments.
